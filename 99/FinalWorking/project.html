			<h2>Developing an Engaging Web Solution for The Liberty Project's Bike Fundraiser</h2>
			
            <p>The project was developed by the team as the team is currently working with the non-profit,
            The Liberty Project to develop a webpage on their website dedicated to their new fundraising
            initiave, a multi-day bike fundraising even</p>

			<h1>The Problem Statement</h1>
				
			<h2>What is the ideal outcome for this project?</h2>
				
			<p>To have a way for people to be able view where the riders are on 
			the course for a multi-day bike fundraising event to increase engagment
			for the event as is it occuring.</p>
				
			<h2>What is the current reality?</h2>
				
			<p>There is no way for users to see where the riders are on the 
			event course for the fundraiser event while it is occurring. In addition, 
			there is limited funding from the organization to build a solution to solve
			the current problem.</p>
				
			<h2>What are the consequences if a solution is not created?</h2>
				
			<p>If users cannot view the riders on the course during the 
			event, there may be loss interest while event is occurring which may result 
			in an overall loss of day-of donations and engagment from home. This is a 
			limited time event so the more excitement that is generated on the days that
			the event is occuring will potentially able lead to more donations 
			and as well as knowledge of the organization itself to the general public.</p>
				
			<h2>What is the teams proposal?</h2>
				
			<p>The team will generate a web map that will showcase where the riders 
			are on the course for the multi-day bike fundraiser event, 
			OnTheMoveFundraising, for The Liberty Project.</p>

			<h1>The Journey to the Solution</h1>
			
			<h2>The Beginning </h2>
			
				<p>The original idea that was generated to solve the Problem Statement was to use Live 
				Tracking where the riders live location would be shown on the webpage created for the fundraising
				event and users could see how the rides are progressing on the route during the day and over the
				course of the multi-day event. 
				
				After looking at options to achieve Live Tracking and consulting with the advisor for the project, it was 
				found that integrating live tracking onto a webpage would need a designated App which is outside 
				the scope of this particular project and for the product that is going to be built for The 
				Liberty Project. Upon this information, the team set off to find alternative solutions to solve 
				the Problem Statment.</p>
			
			<h2>The Middle Steps</h2>
			
				<p>While exploring alternatives to Live Tracking that would still carry the essence
				of visually showing where the riders were on the designated course to increase public engagement
				and interest of the event, the team generated multiple solutions that could be used for the event's 
				webpage through Mapbox functionalities as well as two other noteable discoveries - one using Mapbox
				and another through widgets.</p>
			
			<h2>Solutions</h2>
			<!--Make it as a list-->
				<p>1. Animated Map Tracking</p>
				<p>2. Interactive Storytelling</p>
			
			<h2>Noteable Discoveries</h2>
			<!--Make it as a list-->
				<p>1. Social Media Widgets</p>
				<p>2. Animated Point Along a Route</p>
			
				<p>The team worked together to fully research and explore these options and creating 
				customized working versions	working concepts of each idea. Each solution and discovery is
				presented in greater detail on the Solutions and Discoveries pages - also found under the
				drop down on the navigation bar under Project.</p>
			
			<h2>The End</h2>
			
				<p>Once the solutions and noteable discoveries were fully brought to life as working products, the 
				team came together to build this website to showcase the solutions and "almost" solutions 
				to the Problem Statement.</p>
