        <p>The team was able to discover two workable solutions to the Problem Statement that would allow the

        non-profit, The Liberty Project.</p>

                <h2>Mapbox Tutorial</h2>
                <p> The second working solution that the team came up with involved the animation of a route in a web map using the Mapbox GL JS tutorial, <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/live-update-feature/">Update a Feature in Realtime</a>. 
                        This tutorial provided framework where a feature that exists on a map can be updated. The tutorial example displays a path being drawn where the map view moves along side, following
                where the route is going - as though the data is occuring in real-time, like how Live Tracking would be displayed!</p>
                <p>Further experimentation by the team,  lead to exploring working with a GeoJSON layer representing the route layer 
                with a web map.</p>

            <p>Upon exploring the Mapbox tutorial, the team discovered a tool to examine working a basic line animation using a GeoJSON. However, the 
            team was unable to sucessfully impliment our own GeoJSON layer where it was found to be a struggle to make the animation work with
            GeoJSON files that we had made.</p>

            THE ANIMATION
            From there, we began to experiment with templates and our own GeoJSON files that represened the route layer.

            <h2>The Final Solution</h2>
        <!--Add link for Mapbos's tutorial, Create a custom style: https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/create-a-custom-style/-->
            <p>A final solution was developed with further refinement of a custom GeoJSON file and custom map style applied which were both developed and generated in Mapbox. 
                Armed with this information, the route model was refined and the code was customizard to better reflect the path which resulted in a more 
                user-friendly viewing experience.</p>
