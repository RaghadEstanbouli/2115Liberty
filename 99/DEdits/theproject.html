        <h1>OnTheMoveFundraising</h1>
        <h2>Developing an Engaging Web Solution for The Liberty Project's Bike Fundrasier</h2>
        <p>The project was developed by the team as the team is currently working with the non-profit,
            The Liberty Project to develop a webpage on their website dedicated to their new fundraising
            initiave, a multi-day bike fundraising even 
        </p>


        <h1>The Problem Statement</h1>

        <h2>What is the ideal outcome from this project?</h2>
        <p>TO have a way for people to be able view where the riders are on 
            the course for a multi-day bike fundraising event to increase engagment
            for the event.</p>

        <h2>What is the current reality?</h2>
        <p>There is no way for viewers to see where the riders are on the 
            event course for the fundraiser event while it is occurring. In addition, 
            there is limited funding from the organization.</p>

        <h2>What are the consequences if a solution is not created?</h2>
        <p>If supporters/viewers cannot view the riders on the course during the 
            event, there may be loss interest on day(s) of event which may result 
            in overall loss of day-of donations and  engagment from home (COVID, 
            etc). This is a limited time event so the more excitement that is 
            built on the day of will potentially able to generate more donations 
            and knowledge of the organization to the general public.</p>

        <h2>What is our group's proposal?</h2>
        <p>The team will generate a web map that will showcase where the riders 
            are on the course for the multi-day bike fundraiser event, 
            OnTheMoveFundraising, for The Liberty Project. </p>

        <h2>Technology To Be Explored and Used</h2>
        <p>Mapbox</p>
        <p>Animated Time Segments</p>
        <p>Interactive Storytelling</p>

        <p>The original idea that was generated to solve the problem was to have live 
            tracking of the riders during the event shown on the webpage generated for the fundraising
            event. After looking at numeerous options to acheive this and consulting with the advisor 
            for the project, it was concluded that integrating live tracking onto a webpage would need
            a designated app and the team set off to find alternative solutions to solve the problem.

            While exploring alternatives to live tracking that would still carry the essence
            of visually showing the riders on the designated course and increasing engagement of the event
            for the public, the team generated multiple potential ideas that could be used for the event's webpage.
            
            The team explored three (or is it two?) solutions that could be generated to :
            
            1. Animated Time Segments Using Mapbox
            2. Interactive Storytelling Using Mapbox
