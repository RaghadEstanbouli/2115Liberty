			<h2>Developing an Engaging Web Solution for The Liberty Project's Bike Fundraiser</h2>
			
            <p>The project was developed by the team as the team is currently working with the 
				non-profit, The Liberty Project to develop a webpage on their website dedicated 
				to their new fundraising initiative, a multi-day bike fundraising event.</p>

			<h1>The Problem Statement</h1>
				
			<h2>What is the ideal outcome for this project?</h2>
				
			<p>To have a way for people to be able view where the riders are on the course for a 
				multi-day bike fundraising event to increase engagement for the event as is it occurring.</p>
				
			<h2>What is the current reality?</h2>
				
			<p>There is no way for users to see where the riders are on the 
			event course for the fundraiser event while it is occurring. In addition, 
			there is limited funding from the organization to build a solution to solve
			the current problem.</p>
				
			<h2>What are the consequences if a solution is not created?</h2>
				
			<p>If users cannot view the riders on the course during the event, there may be loss interest 
				while event is occurring which may result in an overall loss of day-of donations and engagement 
				from home. This is a limited time event so the more excitement that is generated on the days 
				that the event is occurring will potentially able lead to more donations and as well as 
				knowledge of the organization itself to the general public.</p>
				
			<h2>What is the teams proposal?</h2>
				
			<p>The team will generate a web map that will showcase where the riders 
			are on the course for the multi-day bike fundraiser event, 
			OnTheMoveFundraising, for The Liberty Project.</p>

			<h1>The Journey to the Solution</h1>
			
			<h2>The Beginning </h2>
			
				<p>The original idea that was generated to solve the Problem Statement was to use Live Tracking where 
					the riderâ€™s live location would be shown on the webpage created for the fundraising event and users 
					could see how the rides are progressing on the route during the day and over the course of the 
					multi-day event. 
				
					After looking at options to achieve Live Tracking and consulting with the advisor for the project,
					 it was found that integrating live tracking onto a webpage would need a designated App which is 
					 outside the scope of this particular project and for the product that is going to be built for 
					 The Liberty Project. Upon this information, the team set off to find alternative solutions to 
					 solve the Problem Statement.</p>
			
			<h2>The Middle Steps</h2>
			
				<p>While exploring alternatives to Live Tracking that would still carry the essence of visually 
					showing where the riders were on the designated course to increase public engagement and interest 
					of the event, the team generated multiple solutions that could be used for the event's webpage 
					through Mapbox functionalities as well as two other notable discoveries - one using Mapbox and 
					another through widgets</p>
			
			<h2>Solutions</h2>
			<!--Make it as a list-->
				<p>1. Animated Map Tracking</p>
				<p>2. Interactive Storytelling</p>
			
			<h2>Noteable Discoveries</h2>
			<!--Make it as a list-->
				<p>1. Social Media Widgets</p>
				<p>2. Animated Point Along a Route</p>
			
				<p>The team worked together to fully research and explore these options and creating customized 
					working versions working concepts of each idea. Each solution and discovery is presented in 
					greater detail on the Solutions and Discoveries pages - also found under the drop down on the 
					navigation bar under Project.</p>
			
			<h2>The End</h2>
			
				<p>Once the solutions and notable discoveries were fully brought to life as working products, the 
					team came together to build this website to showcase the solutions and "almost" solutions to 
					the Problem Statement.</p>
