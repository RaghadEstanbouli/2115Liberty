			<h2>Developing an Engaging Web Solution for The Liberty Project's Bike Fundraiser</h2>
			
            	<p>This website will guide you through the final group project that was developed by the Vanritto 
		    team for the Fleming College course, GEOM99 Web GIS Development. As the team is currently 
		    working with the non-profit,  <a href=" https://www.the-libertyproject.org/" target=”_blank”>The Liberty Project</a>,
		    to develop a webpage on their site to support their new fundraising initiative, 
		    OnTheMoveFundraising, a multi-day bike fundraising event, we took the opportunity to explore 
		    interactive web map options to develop a web solution that is interactive and engaging for 
		    the public. More engagement leads to more donations! To start, the team gathered and generated 
		    a problem statement with that would help guide them to find working solutions that will benefit 
		    The Liberty Project and their fundraising event. </p>

			<h1>The Problem Statement</h1>
				
			<h2>What is the ideal outcome for this project?</h2>
				
			<p>To have a way for people to be able view where the riders are on the course for a 
				multi-day bike fundraising event to increase engagement for the event as is it occurring.</p>
				
			<h2>What is the current reality?</h2>
				
			<p>There is no way for users to see where the riders are on the 
			event course for the fundraiser event while it is occurring. In addition, 
			there is limited funding from the organization to build a solution to solve
			the current problem.</p>
				
			<h2>What are the consequences if a solution is not created?</h2>
				
			<p>If users cannot view the riders on the course during the event, there may be loss interest 
				while event is occurring which may result in an overall loss of day-of donations and engagement 
				from home. This is a limited time event so the more excitement that is generated on the days 
				that the event is occurring will potentially able lead to more donations and as well as 
				knowledge of the organization itself to the general public.</p>
				
			<h2>What is the teams proposal?</h2>
				
			<p>The team will generate a web map that will showcase where the riders 
			are on the course for the multi-day bike fundraiser event, 
			OnTheMoveFundraising, for The Liberty Project.</p>

			<h1>Technology Explored</h1>
			<!-- Make a list or something? -->
			<p>1. Mapbox</p>
			<p>2. Leaflet</p>
			<p>3. Google My Maps</p>
			<p>4. Social Media Widgets</p>

			<h1>The Journey to the Solution</h1>
			
			<h2>The Beginning </h2>
			
			<p>The original idea that the team had come up with to solve the Problem Statement 
				was to use Live Tracking where the rider’s live location would be shown on 
				the webpage created for the fundraising event. This would allow the public 
				to see how the riders were progressing on the route during the day and over 
				the course of the multi-day event. During this time, the team was looking at 
				various platforms that would allow them to generate web maps. This included 
				looking at <a href=" https://www.mapbox.com/" target="_blank">Mapbox</a>, 
				<a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a>, 
				<a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/about/mymaps/" target="_blank"> Google My Maps </a>, 
				and widgets for social media.</p>
				
				<p>After looking at options to have Live Tracking and consulting with the Advisor 
				for the project, it was found that integrating live tracking onto a webpage would 
				not be feasible as Live Tracking needs a designated App. This was found to 
				be outside the scope of this particular project for the Web GIS Development 
				course and for the product that is going to be built for The Liberty Project. 
				Upon finding out this information, the team set off to find alternative 
				solutions to solve the Problem Statement.</p>
			
			<h2>The Middle Steps</h2>
			
			<p>While exploring alternatives to Live Tracking that would still carry the essence of visually 
				showing where the riders were on the designated course or how the event was progressing 
				over the days to increase public engagement and interest of the event, the team generated 
				multiple solutions that could be used for the event's webpage through Mapbox functionalities.  
				The team was also found two other notable discoveries - one using Mapbox and another through
				social media widgets. These are discussed in more detail on the 
				<a href="https://hollieegg.github.io/web1/99/vanritto/solutions.html">Solutions</a> and 
				<a href="https://hollieegg.github.io/web1/99/vanritto/discoveries.html">Discoveries</a> pages. 
				The team set off once again to  research and explore these options and creating customized 
				working versions working concepts of each idea.</p>
			

			<h2>The Discoveries</h2>
			<!--Make it as a list-->
			<p>1. Animated Point Along a Route</p>
			<p>2. Social Media Widgets</p>
		
			<h2>The Solutions</h2>
			<!--Make it as a list-->
			<p>1. Interactive Storytelling</p>
			<p>2. Animated Map Tracking</p>
			
			<h2>The End</h2>
			
				<p>Once the solutions and discoveries were fully brought to life as customized working 
					products, the team worked together to build this website to display the results.</p>
