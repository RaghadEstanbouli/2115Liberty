        <h1>The Problem Statement</h1>

        <h2>Ideal</h2>
        <p>TO have a way for people to be able view where the riders are on 
            the course for a multi-day bike fundraising event.</p>

        <h2>Reality</h2>
        <p>There is no way for viewers to see where the riders are on the 
            event course for the fundraiser event while it is occurring. In addition, 
            there is limited funding from the organization.</p>

        <h2>Consequences</h2>
        <p>If supporters/viewers cannot view the riders on the course during the 
            event, there may be loss interest on day(s) of event which may result 
            in overall loss of day-of donations and  engagment from home (COVID, 
            etc). This is a limited time event so the more excitement that is 
            built on the day of will potentially able to generate more donations 
            and knowledge of the organization to the general public.</p>

        <h2>Proposal</h2>
        <p>A web map will showcase where the riders are on the course for the 
            multi-day bike fundraiser event, OnTheMoveFundraising, for The Liberty 
            Project.  This will be achieved through use use of Mapbox and animated 
            time segments. </p>

        <h2>Technology Used</h2>
        <p>Mapbox</p>
